ditz2be_xml.py is a script which reads a Ditz
(https://rubygems.org/gems/ditz/) issue database and produces XML output
suitable for importing into a Bugs Everywhere
(http://www.bugseverywhere.org/) database. The XML is written to
the standard output, and logging and error information to the
standard error stream.

Usage::

    ditz2be_xml.py > ditz-export.xml
    be import-xml -p -r <ID> ditz-export.xml

Here, ID is the UUID of the root bugdir for the issues imported from the XML
file; this can be found by listing the .be directory. If there is only
one bugdir, this can be done automatically with bash, ls, and cut::

    be import-xml -p -r $(ls -d .be/*-*-* | cut -d/ -f2) ditz-export.xml

The ``-p`` flag is necessary because issues and targets in the XML are
cross-referenced using UUIDs generated by ditz2be_xml.py. Without this
flag, ``be`` will generate new UUIDs and lose the cross-referencing
information.
 
A bash script, convert.sh, automates the process for the
simple case where Python script, Ditz database, and Bugs Everywhere
database are all in the current directory.
