title: Review renderCalendar function
desc: "On generating tables see\n\
  http://www.demosthenes.info/blog/357/Generating-An-HTML5-Calendar-With-PHP\n      \n\
  mktime converts a given date to standard Unix time. (As we don\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
  need information on a specific day, we use the 1st of the month\n\
  as an arbitrary starting point). Given that, we can determine the\n\
  number of days in the chosen month, and when the 1st of the month\n\
  falls (w as a keyword in the date() function provides an offset\n\
  for the 1st day in the month: if the 1st falls on a Sunday, the\n\
  result will be 0, Monday will be 1, Saturday 6, etc.)\n\n\
  $nextday starts the count for the days after the current month;\n\
  $next generates the Unix time for the following month.\n\n\
  If the chosen month does not start on a Sunday,\n\
  $prevmonthdaystart determines the appropriate date from the\n\
  previous month that does fall on a Sunday.\n\n\
  $calendarWeeks is a bit of holdover from the original,\n\
  table-based layout of the calendar, but still useful: it\n\
  determines how many weeks there are in the chosen month.  A\n\
  series of for loops generates the appropriate <time> tags with\n\
  datetime attributes, links, and visible dates inside each.\n\
  (str_pad ensures that leading zeros are added where appropriate).\n\n\
  That\xE2\x80\x99s it! Link destinations are left blank for you to complete.\n\n\
  Now we have to call on the function to produce the calendar with\n\
  appropriate month and year information, which will be another\n\
  article."
